## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Choose an example** based on your use case
2. **Navigate to the example directory**
3. **Follow the README** in each example
4. **Copy and customize** for your needs

```bash
# Start with basic usage
cd basic-usage/
terraform init
terraform apply

# Or jump to multi-environment
cd multi-environment/
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your settings
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## 🔧 Common Patterns

### User Role Patterns

```hcl
# Read-only application user
resource "redisacl_user" "readonly" {
  name     = "app-readonly"
  keys     = "~app:* ~cache:*"
  commands = "+@read -@write -@dangerous"
}

# Write application user
resource "redisacl_user" "readwrite" {
  name     = "app-readwrite"
  keys     = "~app:* ~temp:*"
  commands = "+@read +@write -@dangerous"
}

# Admin user
resource "redisacl_user" "admin" {
  name     = "admin"
  keys     = "~*"
  commands = "+@all"
  allow_self_mutation = true
}

# Monitoring user
resource "redisacl_user" "monitoring" {
  name     = "monitoring"
  keys     = "~"  # No key access
  commands = "+ping +info +client +memory"
}
```

### Connection Patterns

```hcl
# Local development
provider "redisacl" {
  address = "localhost:6379"
}

# Production with authentication
provider "redisacl" {
  address  = "prod-redis.example.com:6379"
  password = var.redis_password
}

# Secure with TLS
provider "redisacl" {
  address  = "secure-redis.example.com:6380"
  password = var.redis_password
  use_tls  = true
}

# High availability with Sentinel
provider "redisacl" {
  password = var.redis_password
  sentinel = {
    master_name = "mymaster"
    addresses   = ["sentinel1:26379", "sentinel2:26379"]
  }
}
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

All examples assume you have:

- **Terraform** 1.0+ installed
- **Redis server** accessible (local or remote)
- **Docker** (for TLS certificate generation)
- **Basic Redis knowledge** (helpful but not required)

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set Redis connection via environment
export REDIS_URL="redis://user:pass@host:port/db"

# Use with provider
provider "redisacl" {
  # Will use REDIS_URL if no other config provided
}
```

### Variable Files
```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
redis_configs = {
  dev = {
    address = "localhost:6379"
    password = "dev-pass"
  }
  prod = {
    address = "prod-redis.com:6379"
    password = "prod-pass"
  }
}
```

### Conditional Resources
```hcl
# Create admin user only in development
resource "redisacl_user" "debug_admin" {
  count = var.environment == "dev" ? 1 : 0
  
  name     = "debug-admin"
  commands = "+@all"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Configuration

### Validate Configuration
```bash
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

### Test User Access
```bash
# Test with redis-cli
redis-cli -u redis://username:password@host:port
> PING
> SET test:key "value"
> GET test:key
```

### Verify Permissions
```bash
# Should work for read user
redis-cli --user readonly-user -a password GET app:data

# Should fail for read user
redis-cli --user readonly-user -a password SET app:data "value"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   ```
   Error: Unable to connect to Redis
   ```
   - Check Redis server is running
   - Verify address and port
   - Check authentication credentials

2. **Permission Denied**
   ```
   Error: NOPERM this user has no permissions
   ```
   - Verify user exists and is enabled
   - Check ACL rules match your expectations
   - Use `ACL GETUSER username` to debug

3. **TLS Issues**
   ```
   Error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
   ```
   - Check certificate paths
   - Verify CA certificate
   - See [TLS example](./tls-example/) for detailed troubleshooting

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Terraform state
terraform show
terraform state list

# Verify Redis ACL
redis-cli ACL LIST
redis-cli ACL GETUSER username

# Test connection
redis-cli -u redis://user:pass@host:port ping
```
